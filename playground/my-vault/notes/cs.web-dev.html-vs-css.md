HTML is not a programming language. HTML is a markup language that is used to structure content on the web. CSS, on the other hand, is a style sheet language that is used to style HTML elements selectively. CSS canâ€™t function alone; it depends on a markup language like HTML.

## In detail

HTML is a markup language that is used to structure content on the web. It provides a way to describe the structure of text-based information in a document by using tags and attributes.

CSS, on the other hand, is a style sheet language that is used to style HTML elements selectively. It provides a way to describe how elements should be displayed on the screen, on paper, or in other media.

While both HTML and CSS are used in web development, they serve different purposes. HTML provides the structure of the content, while CSS provides the style.

In summary, HTML is not a programming language because it doesn't have the ability to perform computations or manipulate data. CSS, however, can be considered a programming language because it has the ability to manipulate data and perform computations.

JAMstack is an approach to frontend web development that allows developers to quickly create and efficiently serve static websites to users. It is an acronym for Javascript, APIs, and Markup, and is a technology stack used to build web applications. The Jamstack is not about specific technologies, but rather a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. It is designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale.

The core principles of JAMstack are pre-rendering and decoupling. Pre-rendering means that the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN, reducing the cost, complexity and risk of dynamic servers as critical infrastructure. Decoupling means that the web experience layer is decoupled from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

JAMstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience. Instead of relying on server-side code to generate HTML on-the-fly for each request from the client-side code (as in traditional web development), JAMstack sites rely on pre-built HTML files that are served directly from a CDN. This approach makes JAMstack sites faster and more secure than traditional sites.

JAMstack also makes it easier to scale web applications. Because JAMstack sites are pre-built into static pages and assets during a build process, they can be served directly from a CDN. This means that they can be scaled globally with ease.

Overall, JAMstack is an exciting new approach to frontend web development that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.
